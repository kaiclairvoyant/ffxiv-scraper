# ffxiv-scraper
### Python scraper for the ffxiv job guide using Scrapy.
The main purpose of this project is to build data in a json file that serves as the database for the FF14 jobs app.

# Running the script
Simply run `py spider-script.py` to execute the script and download all the info and images to their specific locations.

Images are located in the `icon-images` folder

All data is located in the `data.json` json file

# About
### This is my first project in python :)

After reaching 2 years of experience as a backend developer building APIs with PHP, I decided to expand my horizons. I wanted to try out new programming languages and build something different.
Both `ffxiv-scraper` and `FF14 Jobs` were built together, in python and flutter respectively, to force myself to get out of my comfort zone and deal with different situations and different hardships so that I become a better, more flexible developer.
